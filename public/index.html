    <h3>Some Of My Favorite Games</h3>
    <ol id="games"></ol>
    <p>The main reason I chose the topic of my favorite games in an ordered list is because it was the easiest topic to list and organize for me. <br>
    Minecraft would probably be my favorite game of all time due to the insane replayablility, and I grew up with the game and culture.</p>
